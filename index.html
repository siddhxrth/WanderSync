            <h2>Conclusions and Reflections</h2>
            <p>Our team is proud to present the WanderSync App, a user-friendly Android application designed to simplify trip planning and organization. Throughout the development process in Android Studio, we collaborated closely to create a seamless platform for users to manage their travel plans, including destination suggestions, activity scheduling, and real-time weather updates. Each team member contributed significantly, from implementing core features and designing an intuitive interface to integrating APIs and testing the app for performance and usability. Together, we ensured the app was both functional and visually appealing.

                The journey to completing this project was both challenging and rewarding. As a team, we navigated a steep learning curve with Android Studio, tackled technical issues such as offline data synchronization, and maintained strong coordination despite tight deadlines. These challenges pushed us to find innovative solutions and foster effective communication. The experience not only strengthened our technical skills but also highlighted the value of teamwork in achieving a shared goal. We are excited to share the Travel Itinerary App and hope it enhances the travel experience for our users.</p>
